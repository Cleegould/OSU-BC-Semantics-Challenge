# OSU-BC-Semantics-Challenge
Project Number 1 Semantic Challenge
https://cleegould.github.io/OSU-BC-Semantics-Challenge/

In this project we refracted code to match an exciting page.  We used semantics and updated the CSS file to make sure our final product was user-friendly with working links, matching pictures, colors and fonts.
